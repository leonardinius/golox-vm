# (Go) Lox (Crafting interpreters)

This is an implementation of [The Lox Programming Language](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html) implemented in Go.

I have made so far:

- Golang Lox interpreter <https://github.com/leonardinius/golox>
- C language bytecode VM, basically just going slowly page by page in book and ^C^V the code from there <https://github.com/leonardinius/clox>

This repository is re-implementation of what I have learned in clox VM bytecode with glolang.

Wish me luck.
